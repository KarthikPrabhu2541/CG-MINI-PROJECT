# CG-MINI-PROJECT
this repository is also to learn more about github and upload our mini project on computer graphics

This Project on Computer Graphics using GLUT.H simulates a sierpinski pyramid upto 5 divisions

It has three phases 

Phase 1:
The Pyramid initially with just 4 sides and no divisions rotates about y axis for 90 degree angle 
After every 90 degree rotation it gets divided into 2 for each pyramid. This happens for 5 times.

Phase 2:
The Pyramid now is scaled and translated simultaneously such that the top pyramid is brought to the centre of the screen.

Phase 3:
The whole pyramid is scaled until the top pyramid size matches the original pyramid.
The pyramid completes its 90 degree rotation and the rest of the new pyramid is removed and the whole thing loops back.

Implementation:

#Steps to Run the Project

step 1 : Setup Glut(OpenGL) library on an IDE that can run C/C++ projects (Preferably Codeblocks)
step 2 : Create a new c Project in glut application in the IDE
step 3 : Type the above main.cpp file into the main.cpp file of the project
step 4 : Build and run the project
